# SKO's Space Engineers Mods Repository

Welcome to SKO's Space Engineers Mods Repository! This repository is dedicated to hosting a collection of mods created for the game Space Engineers.

## Contributing and Proposing Changes

If you'd like to propose fixes or changes to the code, please follow these steps:

1. Create a new branch named `fix/<fix-name>` or `feature/<feature-name>` from the `main` branch.
2. Implement and thoroughly test your changes.
3. Submit a Pull Request and notify SKO to review the modifications.
4. To ensure a smooth review process, please keep Pull Requests focused on specific fixes or features rather than introducing large changes. This helps maintain a clear and reviewable codebase.

## Review and Deployment

All Pull Requests will undergo a review by SKO. Once changes are merged into the main branch, a new version will be deployed on Steam.
